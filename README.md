Final exams are in 2 weeks, and I told myself that if I'm not good at linked lists by a week and a half, I might as well just give up on living. Hence, this repository is born where you'll see me going back to square one and participating in LeetCode and Exercism, but we all know majority of my codes are yoinked from ChatGPT himself because I can't code shit straight from my brain. Enjoy.
